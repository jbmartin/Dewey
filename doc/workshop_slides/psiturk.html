# What DOES it do for you?

- Handle the most common sequence of interactions a subject in an experiment will need to do
    1. View ad for .red[**HIT**]
    1. Present debriefing form
    1. Verify the workerId hasn't participated in your experiment before
    1. Launch experiment as external hit
    1. (Present instructions)
    1. (Display Experiment)
    1. Communicate back to AMT when job is done
    1. (Store data in a local database)
    1. (Store data INCREMENTALLY in a local database)
    1. Record how long the user took to do the task
    1. Handles and records drop-outs
    1. etc...
    
- Helps to automatically submit hits, check your current Amazon funds balance, and assign credit

- The code provides an example of a dynamic Javascript experiment that does a Stroop-like task which you can extend however you like.

# What is it actually?

- A small webserver that you run in Python that makes it very easy to customize

- You launch the webserver by just running the Python script

- It runs on a designated port on your computer

- You point the .blue[**Workers**] at this url

- Everything should run smoothly

Based on three key open-source packages:

# Software dependencies

**Python**  
If you've never used Python before, we recommend you use the [Enthought Python distribution](http://www.enthought.com/repo/.epd_academic_installers), 
because it comes with easy_install, a tool for easily installing Python packages.

Once you've installed Enthought, you should be able to open a terminal window and install **Flask** (the web server library we'll be using) and **SQLAlchemy** 
(the database manipulation package we'll be using) with the following command:

    .bash
    easy_install Flask-SQLAlchemy

If you get a permissions error, try:

    .bash
    sudo easy_install Flask-SQLAlchemy

(which will prompt you for your password)

---

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Software dependencies

You will also find it useful to install **boto**, a Python library which enables interaction with Amazon's Mechanical Turk servers 
to help assign credit to participants.  To install:

    .bash
    easy_install boto

Finally, you can try getting things up and running by cloning our repository using the following command:

    .bash
    git clone git://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk.git

(Further instructions are provided here: [http://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk](http://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk))

# Model, View, Controller (MVC) 

A common software development pattern.  If you are _not_ a scientist and do
end-user programming (e.g., Android, iOS, webapps), this is probably how you 
are designing things.
<img src="images/MVC.png" align="right" width="350">

- **Model** is basically your data.  
    - A common situation is for the model to contains the abstract logic of your
    application
    - What kind of data is being stored, how it is formatted, is there computation that the app is supposed to do?

- **Controller** is the "glue" which binds the model to the view
    
- **View** is the UI elements presented to a user of the software
    - Independent of the model 
    - Idea is object-oriented encapsulation...  the graphics people can design the interface
    while the engineers build the model

# Scary?

No.  Basically we just are giving you a pre-structured website which
you can fill in with the info for you study.  In addition, our code
handles some of the logic a AMT experiment might need like counterbalancing, etc...

## It's not scary, it's going to be fun!

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# File listing

- **models.py** defines the **Model**

- **app.py** is the **Controller**

- The various HTML files inside the templates/, static/ folders are the **View**

# Model (i.e., database) structure

Defined in **models.py**:

    .python
    class Participant(Base):
    	"""
    	Object representation of a participant in the database.
    	"""
    	__tablename__ = TABLENAME
    
    	assignmentid =Column(String(128), primary_key=True)
    	hitid = Column(String(128))
    	workerid = Column(String(128))
    	ipaddress = Column(String(128))
    	cond = Column(Integer)
    	counterbalance = Column(Integer)
    	codeversion = Column(String(128))
    	beginhit = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    	beginexp = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    	endhit = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    	status = Column(Integer, default = 1)
    	debriefed = Column(Boolean)
    	datastring = Column(Text, nullable=True)

has fields for tracking the assignmentId, hitId, workerId, ipaddress of worker,
condition, the data file, etc...

# Status codes

Possible status codes are defined at the top of the file

    .python
	# Status codes
	ALLOCATED = 1

	DEBRIEFED = 4
	CREDITED = 5
	QUITEARLY = 6

# Controller: The most important idea

- **app.py** runs a webserver which is basically listening for requests (i.e., requests are attempts to access a particular URL)

- These requests are handled using .red['routes'] which are simple functions in **app.py** that run in response to a URL request.

- Normal web server:
    - You request http://gureckslab.org/coolpage.html
    - The server sends the content of coolpage.html in a format your browser can read and display
    
- **app.py** server:
    - You request http://gureckislab.org/mturk
    - The server runs a python function associated with the 'mturk' .red['route']
    - This function may, or may not also send to the user's browser some HTML can it can read and display
    - However, since it is a Python function, can do lots of other stuff like add data to a database, etc...

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# An example

If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/consent], this function will run

    .python
    @app.route('/consent', methods=['GET'])
    def give_consent():
    	"""
    	Serves up the consent in the popup window.
    	"""
    	if not (request.args.has_key('hitId') and \
    		   request.args.has_key('assignmentId') and \
    		   request.args.has_key('workerId')):
    		raise ExperimentError('hit_assign_worker_id_not_set_in_consent')
    	hitId=request.args ['hitId']
    	assignmentId = request.args ['assignmentId']
    	workerId = request.args ['workerId']
    	print hitId, assignmentId, workerId
    	
    	return render_template('consent.html', hitid = hitId, assignmentid=assignmentId, workerid=workerId)

which checks to see if the workerid is set correctly and basically prints out the 'consent.html' template (last line)
into the users browser window.

**So a layer of computation/logic is inserted into any web requests!! **

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# A more complex example

If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/debrief], this function will run

	.python
	@app.route('/debrief', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
	def savedata():
	    """
	    User has finished the experiment and is posting their data in the form of a
	    (long) string. They will receive a debreifing back.
	    """
	    print request.form.keys()
	    if not (request.form.has_key('assignmentid') and request.form.has_key('data')):
	        raise ExperimentError('improper_inputs')
	    assignmentId = request.form ['assignmentid']
	    datastring = request.form ['data']
	    print assignmentId, datastring
	    
	    user = Participant.query.\
	            filter(Participant.assignmentid == assignmentId).\
	            one()
	    user.status = COMPLETED
	    user.datastring = datastring
	    user.endhit = datetime.datetime.now()
	    db_session.add(user)
	    db_session.commit()
	    
	    return render_template('debriefing.html', assignmentId=assignmentId)

which updates the database so that we know the user finished the task, and then
prints out the debriefing form to the user's browser window.

---

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# An example which doesn't display anything in the browser
If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/debrief], this function will run

	.python
	@app.route('/inexp', methods=['POST'])
	def enterexp():
	    """
	    AJAX listener that listens for a signal from the user's script when they
	    leave the instructions and enter the real experiment. After the server
	    receives this signal, it will no longer allow them to re-access the
	    experiment applet (meaning they can't do part of the experiment and
	    referesh to start over).
	    """
	    print "/inexp"
	    if not request.form.has_key('assignmentid'):
	        raise ExperimentError('improper_inputs')
	    assignmentId = request.form ['assignmentid']
	    user = Participant.query.\
	            filter(Participant.assignmentid == assignmentId).\
	            one()
	    user.status = STARTED
	    user.beginexp = datetime.datetime.now()
	    db_session.add(user)
	    db_session.commit()
	    return "Success"

updates the model (i.e., database) so that the user.status is 'STARTED' and the starttime is
recorded

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Persistence

The .orange[**Worker**]'s browser is simply making web requests at various
times as they go through the experiment.  These call up particular '.red[routes]' in 
the **app.py** code.  

What about multiple people doing the experiment at once?  How do we know
who they are?

Remember that on the first request, Amazon sends three variables to your route:

- http://.yellow[yoururl]?.red[**assignmentId**=XX]&.blue[**hitId**=XX]&.green[**workerId**=XX]

We just continue to pass these variables to all new routes we add.  These keys let us
look up the correct user in the databased (based on the workerId and/or assignmentId)
and then update the right person.

---

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Templates

- Rather than just plain HTML, the system uses HTML templates which help you programmatically
generate HTML

- **render_template()** function
		return render_template('debriefing.html', assignmentId=assignmentId)

- Makes a variable called 'assignmentId' available inside the template.

		<form id="accept" action="complete" method="post">
			<input type="hidden" name="assignmentid" value="{{ assignmentId }}" />
			<input type="hidden" name="agree" value="true" />
		</form>

---

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Important routes

- .blue[/mturk]
	- The initial place people go.  If they haven't accepted the .red[HIT] this displays the ad.  Otherwise a launch button.
- .blue[/consent]
	- This displays the consent form (consent.html is the relevant template)
- .blue[/exp]
	- This serves up the actual experiment code (Javascript or whatever).  The relevant template is exp.html/
- .blue[/inexp]
	- This is just a path you can hit that verifies the person is "in the experiment" (done with instructions)
- .blue[/inexpsave]
	- This saves the current data to the database (can be accessed at end of every trial or every block)
- .blue[/quitter]
	- If the person closes the browser window we want to know... This updates the database to indicate this person withdrew.
- .blue[/debrief]
	- This serve up the debriefing form
- .blue[/complete]
	- When the person finishes (but not done with debrief) this is accessed.

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Configuration

- Most of the configutation stuff is accessed through **config.txt**

- John will step through this, but it is heavily commented

- Configures the location of your server, the database, your Amazon account information, etc...
