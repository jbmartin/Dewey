# Overview


1. What is [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) (AMT)?  [Jump to this section](#whatisamt)
    - Who are the people in the system (demographics, etc...)?
    - How can it be used for research?
    - How good is the data?

2. What are the mechanics of using the system? [Jump to this section](#part2)

    - Step through setting up account
    - Using built-in tools to create simple form-based experiments
    
3. Building dynamic web experiments (psiTurk) [Jump to this section](#part3)

    - Introduce a [simple Python-based web-app](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk) we developed which could be a starting framework for your experiment
    - Using the AMT sandbox to develop and test your app
    - Manage hits using command-line tools (avoid too many visits to Amazon's site)

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# The history

<img src="images/bezos.jpg" width="250" align="right"><br>


- Developed by [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) by Peter Cohen

- Originally for in-house use to detect duplicate product postings on Amazon's site .red[*]

- Jeff Bezos calls it "artificial artificial intelligence"

- Name originates from a mechanical chess illusion/automaton by Wolfgang von Kempelen in the 18th century


.footnote[.red[*] Nice summary in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/yourmoney/25Stream.html)]

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# The concept

<img src="images/crowdsource.png" alt="Crowdsourcing" width="300" align="left">
"Normally, a human makes a request of a computer, and the computer does the computation of the task, but artificial artificial intelligences like Mechanical Turk invert all that. The computer has a task that is easy for a human but extraordinarily hard for the computer. So instead of calling a computer service to perform the function, it calls a human.” 

### - Jeff Bezos

---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# What kinds of tasks?

- Difficult for computer (or for use in training machine learning systems)
    - Provide three key words to describe a randomly selected image
    - Does this photograph contain a car?
    - Type the characters in this image (e.g., captcha)
    
- Traditional "work"
    - Go to http://mycompany.com and email me some comments on what you think of the design
    - Write a positive review for this product online (pay per paragraph)
    - Translate this text from english to spanish

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Who are the workers?

- 46.80% US, 34% India, 19.20% Other

- United States demographic
    - 55-65% female
    - Most make <$60k/year
    - Median age of 30
    - Hold bachelor’s and are young
    - Distribution mostly similar to US internet pop.

# What motivates workers?


#.green.center[Money.]

.smallquote[
Mitch Fernandez, 38, a disabled former United States Army linguist, said by e-mail that he became a Turk Worker for various reasons: “At first, I was just curious about the idea of crowdsourcing.” But he said he soon found that by working about two hours a day, he could often earn more than $100 a week. In the last nine months he made around $4,000, which he used to buy a high-definition television, a DVD player and a new subwoofer — all from Amazon.com.]

.smallquote[
“I do this primarily for the money, but I also view it as a form of therapy to get me used to working again.” he explained. “The experience has gotten me thinking about pursuing a library science degree.” - From [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/yourmoney/25Stream.html)
]

<hr>

.smallquote[
"Is it worthwhile? I was genuinely surprised by the experience. If you have the ability to throw down readable writing very quickly, you can earn minimum wage with the Turk – more than I ever expected. Given the short timeframe and the wide variety of tasks available, it’s something that you can sit down and do in short little bits when it’s convenient for you.” - From [The simple Dollar](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/07/05/can-you-actually-earn-reasonable-money-from-mechanical-turk/)
]

---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Compensation

- Median wage is $1.38/hour

- Short tasks (~5 mins) award around 10 cents

- Requester can reject work and revoke payment

- Can also **award bonuses**

- Amazon takes 10% of payments

- Amazon tries to stay out of disputes


---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Why mess with this?

- **Convenient** - and our scripts help you even more

- **Fast** 
    - collect LOTS of data quickly
    - collect large N studies
    - pilot study materials
    - norm/pretest stimuli
    
- **Affordable**
    - Relative to fMRI incredibly cost effective
    - We paid about $2.00 for 15-25 minute session

- **Anonymous**
    - Subject never meets experimenter, in some ways testing conditions more uniform since no RAs
    - Subjects unlikely to know about "your lab" and the types of studies you do

- **Replicable**
    - Very easy to share your experiment code to let people replicate your work cheaply

---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Why .red[stay away]?

- **Quality assurance** Are people following instructions? Can they read them?  Are they "bots" just trying to rip you off?

- **Attrition** the cost (social or otherwise) for closing the browser and quitting the experiment is low

- **Non-lab setting** 
    - You don’t have control over distractions.  
    - People literally could get up and leave for 1 hour in the middle of your experiment

- **Undergrads = mturk population?**  Is this really a different population? 

---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Ethical Issues

- How much should you pay?  As much as the market supports or should it match what you pay in the lab (roughly)?

- Can you get IRB approval for your experiment (yes, you MUST run it by the IRB first)

    - Some IRBs are more cautious than they need to be, IMHO

    - Since participants never meet experimenter and are free to close browser and walk away at any moment the IRB issues seem non-existent (should be exempt, but check with your  local IRB)

    - Main concern would be if materials/stimuli are controversial and might reflect poorly on the field, sponsors, or university

    - Wasn't very difficult to add to an existing IRB at NYU

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Summary

- Eh, it's ok. not perfect.
    - Hard to tell if problems are with AMT data or with previous work (perhaps selection bias with university students?)

- Important lessons
    - Payment doesn't have much effect beyond signup rate
    - Checking people read and comprehend instructions is critical
    - Cleaning up data may help, but good to decide on criterion ahead of time
    
- Huge studies run in 3-4 days.  Does this benefit outweight possible disadvantages?  Do you trust your lab data more?

- Note, our other studies (e.g., stroop, etc...) replicate with much higher fidelity.  Learning experiments
may reflect a sort of special case where caution is particularly advised.
    - See also [this slide](#replicationstudies) for references to other studies reporting success

---

.task[Part 1: What is AMT?]
# Can you actually publish this data?

- Currently, few mainstream cognitive psychology papers which report findings based purely on AMT data

- A few early examples of web-based experimentation in Cognitive Science (e.g., [Mark Steyvers](http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/papers/causalinference.pdf))

- Used heavily in machine learning (e.g., NIPS), in many Cognitive Science Society conference papers, and work on collective/group behavior

- We have a few papers about to be submitted based entirely on AMT data, so we'll see how it goes!

- Obvious solution to reviewer objections is to replicate a few conditions or experiments in the lab as well
    - Easy to do since the code runs just as well in the lab as online

.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Two perspectives:
 
1. What is it like to use AMT as a [**Worker**](#terminology)?
 
2. What is it like to use AMT as a [**Requester**](#terminology)?
   
---
 
.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Using AMT as a .blue[**Worker**]
 
1. Sign up on Amazon's site
 
2. Search for tasks (i.e., .red[**HIT**]s) to do online through the AMT interface.
 
3. Worker accepts a .red[**HIT**].  The task appears in a frame within the AMT website.
 
4. After completing the .red[**HIT**], the worker signals to Amazon that they have completed the task
 
<hr>
 
Some important conceptual notes:
 
- (as we will see) .orange[**Requester**]s send out a job with a certain number of .red[**HIT**]s
 
- When a .blue[**Worker**] accepts the .red[**HIT**] is it removed from the .orange[**Requester**]'s account
 
    - If the .blue[**Worker**] doesn't want to do the task they have to _return_ the .red[**HIT**] to the .orange[**Requester**] so someone else can do it
 
- As a .orange[**Requester**] you get to set how long a .red[**HIT**] can be "held" like this
 
---
 
.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# What is a .red[**HIT**] ?
 
- In our experiments, a .red[**HIT**] is typically an entire experiment (as might be done in the lab)
 
- However, it is up to the .orange[**Requester**] to determine what constitutes a .red[**HIT**].
 
- Could be one trial in an experiment, and you just offer the .blue[**Worker**] as many .red[**HIT**]s as they care to do
 
- Will see some examples in a minute...

# Using AMT as a .orange[**Requester**]
 
1. Open a Amazon Web Services (AWS) account: [Subscribe here](http://aws.amazon.com)
 
1. Get a Mechanical Turk Requester Account: [Subscribe here](http://requester.mturk.com)
   
1. Create a "dummy" email account which you can use to deal with inevitable issues that come up with Workers
    - Workers will contact you when their computer crashes on the last trial of the task, etc...
    - Need a way to deal with this efficiently and quickly
     
1. Use the built-in Amazon template or "External Question" approach to design your experiment
 
1. Test your code on the "sandbox" website before going live
    - Important... if you cause problems you WILL be contacted by users with complaints.
 
1. Go live!

# Using AMT as a .orange[**Requester**]
### Two key types of .red[**HIT**]s
 
- **Amazon Template**
    - Hosted directly on Amazon's servers
    - Mostly restricted to simple HTML
    - Easy to use (don't need your own server)
    - Tools for helping you "build" the question
 
- **External Question**
    - Pushes user off the AMT site to your own website
    - You can leverage full power of the "Interweb" (custom Javascript, Flash, etc...)
    - You need to have a publically accessible webserver
    - Most coding involved
        - Our software is intended to help with this

# More about external questions...
 
     
- The link to the site. Could be anything! Must link back to Amazon at the end (we'll show you how)
 
- You are responsible for:
    - Hosting
       - **At minimum** you need a computer with a web-accessible HTTP server running
       - A static IP address may simplify things
       - You probably want to avoid trying to host it over WiFi since NAT/Firewalls can make your site inaccessible to the global Internet
     
    - Posting your link to Amazon
     
    - Communicating back to Amazon when the .red[**HIT**] has been completed
     
    - Approving completed .red[**HIT**]s for payment in a timely manner

# Hosting an Advertisement

- When participants see your HIT in the list, they will see basic metadata:

- Once they click "View a HIT in this group," they see whatever your site is serving up, in our case this is the default:

<iframe src="http://puncture.psych.nyu.edu:5001/mturk?workerId=testing&assignmentId=testing&hitId=testing"></iframe>

---

# A look at the URLs

That last URL would look like this .red[*]:

- http://puncture.psych.nyu.edu:5001/mturk?assignmentId=.red[XX]&hitId=.red[XX]&workerId=.red[XX]

Basic syntax is as follows:

- http://.yellow[yoururl]?.red[**assignmentId**=XX]&.blue[**hitId**=XX]&.green[**workerId**=XX]

	- .yellow[**yoururl**] is wherever your server is ready for requests.
	- .red[**assignmentId**] is the unique ID assigned by Amazon to the event of
	  this particular person taking performing this particular HIT.
	  ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE means they haven't accepted yet.
	- .blue[**hitId**] is the Amazon ID associated with this HIT.
	- .green[**workerId**] is the Amazon ID associated with each unique worker.

.footnote[.red[*] The .red[XX] are shorthand for usually long strings of letters and numbers.]
---

# Finishing up

The last thing served to the participant is a button they can use to inform
Amazon that they have finished the HIT. This submits a form with their
identifying information to `http://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit`.

# What DOES it do for you?

- Handle the most common sequence of interactions a subject in an experiment will need to do
    1. View ad for .red[**HIT**]
    1. Present debriefing form
    1. Verify the workerId hasn't participated in your experiment before
    1. Launch experiment as external hit
    1. (Present instructions)
    1. (Display Experiment)
    1. Communicate back to AMT when job is done
    1. (Store data in a local database)
    1. (Store data INCREMENTALLY in a local database)
    1. Record how long the user took to do the task
    1. Handles and records drop-outs
    1. etc...
    
- Helps to automatically submit hits, check your current Amazon funds balance, and assign credit

- The code provides an example of a dynamic Javascript experiment that does a Stroop-like task which you can extend however you like.

# What is it actually?

- A small webserver that you run in Python that makes it very easy to customize

- You launch the webserver by just running the Python script

- It runs on a designated port on your computer

- You point the .blue[**Workers**] at this url

- Everything should run smoothly

Based on three key open-source packages:

# Software dependencies

**Python**  
If you've never used Python before, we recommend you use the [Enthought Python distribution](http://www.enthought.com/repo/.epd_academic_installers), 
because it comes with easy_install, a tool for easily installing Python packages.

Once you've installed Enthought, you should be able to open a terminal window and install **Flask** (the web server library we'll be using) and **SQLAlchemy** 
(the database manipulation package we'll be using) with the following command:

    .bash
    easy_install Flask-SQLAlchemy

If you get a permissions error, try:

    .bash
    sudo easy_install Flask-SQLAlchemy

(which will prompt you for your password)

---

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Software dependencies

You will also find it useful to install **boto**, a Python library which enables interaction with Amazon's Mechanical Turk servers 
to help assign credit to participants.  To install:

    .bash
    easy_install boto

Finally, you can try getting things up and running by cloning our repository using the following command:

    .bash
    git clone git://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk.git

# Model, View, Controller (MVC) 

A common software development pattern.  If you are _not_ a scientist and do
end-user programming (e.g., Android, iOS, webapps), this is probably how you 
are designing things.
<img src="images/MVC.png" align="right" width="350">

- **Model** is basically your data.  
    - A common situation is for the model to contains the abstract logic of your
    application
    - What kind of data is being stored, how it is formatted, is there computation that the app is supposed to do?

- **Controller** is the "glue" which binds the model to the view
    
- **View** is the UI elements presented to a user of the software
    - Independent of the model 
    - Idea is object-oriented encapsulation...  the graphics people can design the interface
    while the engineers build the model

# Scary?

No.  Basically we just are giving you a pre-structured website which
you can fill in with the info for you study.  In addition, our code
handles some of the logic a AMT experiment might need like counterbalancing, etc...

# File listing

- **models.py** defines the **Model**

- **app.py** is the **Controller**

# Controller: The most important idea

- **app.py** runs a webserver which is basically listening for requests (i.e., requests are attempts to access a particular URL)

- These requests are handled using .red['routes'] which are simple functions in **app.py** that run in response to a URL request.

- Normal web server:
    - You request http://gureckslab.org/coolpage.html
    - The server sends the content of coolpage.html in a format your browser can read and display
    
- **app.py** server:
    - You request http://gureckislab.org/mturk
    - The server runs a python function associated with the 'mturk' .red['route']
    - This function may, or may not also send to the user's browser some HTML can it can read and display
    - However, since it is a Python function, can do lots of other stuff like add data to a database, etc...

# An example

If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/consent], this function will run

    .python
    @app.route('/consent', methods=['GET'])
    def give_consent():
    	"""
    	Serves up the consent in the popup window.
    	"""
    	if not (request.args.has_key('hitId') and \
    		   request.args.has_key('assignmentId') and \
    		   request.args.has_key('workerId')):
    		raise ExperimentError('hit_assign_worker_id_not_set_in_consent')
    	hitId=request.args ['hitId']
    	assignmentId = request.args ['assignmentId']
    	workerId = request.args ['workerId']
    	print hitId, assignmentId, workerId
    	
    	return render_template('consent.html', hitid = hitId, assignmentid=assignmentId, workerid=workerId)

which checks to see if the workerid is set correctly and basically prints out the 'consent.html' template (last line)
into the users browser window.

**So a layer of computation/logic is inserted into any web requests!! **

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# A more complex example

If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/debrief], this function will run

	.python
	@app.route('/debrief', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
	def savedata():
	    """
	    User has finished the experiment and is posting their data in the form of a
	    (long) string. They will receive a debreifing back.
	    """
	    print request.form.keys()
	    if not (request.form.has_key('assignmentid') and request.form.has_key('data')):
	        raise ExperimentError('improper_inputs')
	    assignmentId = request.form ['assignmentid']
	    datastring = request.form ['data']
	    print assignmentId, datastring
	    
	    user = Participant.query.\
	            filter(Participant.assignmentid == assignmentId).\
	            one()
	    user.status = COMPLETED
	    user.datastring = datastring
	    user.endhit = datetime.datetime.now()
	    db_session.add(user)
	    db_session.commit()
	    
	    return render_template('debriefing.html', assignmentId=assignmentId)

which updates the database so that we know the user finished the task, and then
prints out the debriefing form to the user's browser window.

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# An example which doesn't display anything in the browser
If you request .orange[http://myip.edu:PORT/debrief], this function will run

	.python
	@app.route('/inexp', methods=['POST'])
	def enterexp():
	    """
	    AJAX listener that listens for a signal from the user's script when they
	    leave the instructions and enter the real experiment. After the server
	    receives this signal, it will no longer allow them to re-access the
	    experiment applet (meaning they can't do part of the experiment and
	    referesh to start over).
	    """
	    print "/inexp"
	    if not request.form.has_key('assignmentid'):
	        raise ExperimentError('improper_inputs')
	    assignmentId = request.form ['assignmentid']
	    user = Participant.query.\
	            filter(Participant.assignmentid == assignmentId).\
	            one()
	    user.status = STARTED
	    user.beginexp = datetime.datetime.now()
	    db_session.add(user)
	    db_session.commit()
	    return "Success"

updates the model (i.e., database) so that the user.status is 'STARTED' and the starttime is
recorded

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Persistence

The .orange[**Worker**]'s browser is simply making web requests at various
times as they go through the experiment.  These call up particular '.red[routes]' in 
the **app.py** code.  

What about multiple people doing the experiment at once?  How do we know
who they are?

Remember that on the first request, Amazon sends three variables to your route:

- http://.yellow[yoururl]?.red[**assignmentId**=XX]&.blue[**hitId**=XX]&.green[**workerId**=XX]

We just continue to pass these variables to all new routes we add.  These keys let us
look up the correct user in the databased (based on the workerId and/or assignmentId)
and then update the right person.

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Templates

- Rather than just plain HTML, the system uses HTML templates which help you programmatically
generate HTML

- **render_template()** function
		return render_template('debriefing.html', assignmentId=assignmentId)

- Makes a variable called 'assignmentId' available inside the template.

		<form id="accept" action="complete" method="post">
			<input type="hidden" name="assignmentid" value="{{ assignmentId }}" />
			<input type="hidden" name="agree" value="true" />
		</form>

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Important routes

- .blue[/mturk]
	- The initial place people go.  If they haven't accepted the .red[HIT] this displays the ad.  Otherwise a launch button.
- .blue[/consent]
	- This displays the consent form (consent.html is the relevant template)
- .blue[/exp]
	- This serves up the actual experiment code (Javascript or whatever).  The relevant template is exp.html/
- .blue[/inexp]
	- This is just a path you can hit that verifies the person is "in the experiment" (done with instructions)
- .blue[/inexpsave]
	- This saves the current data to the database (can be accessed at end of every trial or every block)
- .blue[/quitter]
	- If the person closes the browser window we want to know... This updates the database to indicate this person withdrew.
- .blue[/debrief]
	- This serve up the debriefing form
- .blue[/complete]
	- When the person finishes (but not done with debrief) this is accessed.

.task[Part 3: Using psiTurk]
# Configuration

- Most of the configutation stuff is accessed through **config.txt**

- John will step through this, but it is heavily commented

- Configures the location of your server, the database, your Amazon account information, etc...
