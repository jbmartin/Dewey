.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Two perspectives:
 
1. What is it like to use AMT as a [**Worker**](#terminology)?
 
2. What is it like to use AMT as a [**Requester**](#terminology)?

.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Using AMT as a .blue[**Worker**]
 
1. Sign up on Amazon's site
 
2. Search for tasks (i.e., .red[**HIT**]s) to do online through the AMT interface.
 
3. Worker accepts a .red[**HIT**].  The task appears in a frame within the AMT website.
 
4. After completing the .red[**HIT**], the worker signals to Amazon that they have completed the task
 
<hr>
 
Some important conceptual notes:
 
- (as we will see) .orange[**Requester**]s send out a job with a certain number of .red[**HIT**]s
 
- When a .blue[**Worker**] accepts the .red[**HIT**] is it removed from the .orange[**Requester**]'s account
 
    - If the .blue[**Worker**] doesn't want to do the task they have to _return_ the .red[**HIT**] to the .orange[**Requester**] so someone else can do it
 
- As a .orange[**Requester**] you get to set how long a .red[**HIT**] can be "held" like this
 
---
 
.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# What is a .red[**HIT**] ?
 
- In our experiments, a .red[**HIT**] is typically an entire experiment (as might be done in the lab)
 
- However, it is up to the .orange[**Requester**] to determine what constitutes a .red[**HIT**].
 
- Could be one trial in an experiment, and you just offer the .blue[**Worker**] as many .red[**HIT**]s as they care to do
 
- Will see some examples in a minute...

.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Using AMT as a .orange[**Requester**]
 
1. Open a Amazon Web Services (AWS) account: [Subscribe here](http://aws.amazon.com)
 
1. Get a Mechanical Turk Requester Account: [Subscribe here](http://requester.mturk.com)
   
1. Create a "dummy" email account which you can use to deal with inevitable issues that come up with Workers
    - Workers will contact you when their computer crashes on the last trial of the task, etc...
    - Need a way to deal with this efficiently and quickly
     
1. Use the built-in Amazon template or "External Question" approach to design your experiment
 
1. Test your code on the "sandbox" website before going live
    - Important... if you cause problems you WILL be contacted by users with complaints.
 
1. Go live!

.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Using AMT as a .orange[**Requester**]
### Two key types of .red[**HIT**]s
 
- **Amazon Template**
    - Hosted directly on Amazon's servers
    - Mostly restricted to simple HTML
    - Easy to use (don't need your own server)
    - Tools for helping you "build" the question
 
- **External Question**
    - Pushes user off the AMT site to your own website
    - You can leverage full power of the "Interweb" (custom Javascript, Flash, etc...)
    - You need to have a publically accessible webserver
    - Most coding involved
        - Our software is intended to help with this

# More about external questions...
 
     
- The link to the site. Could be anything! Must link back to Amazon at the end (we'll show you how)
 
- You are responsible for:
    - Hosting
       - **At minimum** you need a computer with a web-accessible HTTP server running
       - A static IP address may simplify things
       - You probably want to avoid trying to host it over WiFi since NAT/Firewalls can make your site inaccessible to the global Internet
     
    - Posting your link to Amazon
     
    - Communicating back to Amazon when the .red[**HIT**] has been completed
     
    - Approving completed .red[**HIT**]s for payment in a timely manner
     
    - Dealing quickly with .blue[**Worker**] issues.  Welcome to tech support.
     
    - Saving your data in a secure place, etc..

.task[Part 2: The mechanics]
# Requesting an External Question
 
- **URL** 
    - basic link to your experiment.
- **Title**.
- **Description**.
- **Keywords**.
- **Lifetime**. 
    - _...how long will it be available?_
- **Duration**. 
    - _...how long are people allowed to take?_
- **Qualifications**. 
    - _...country? ...consistency?_
 
_Oddly, there is no web interface for this. You need to use scripts. Fortunately, we've got you covered in [Part 3](psiturk.html)._

# Hosting an Advertisement

- When participants see your HIT in the list, they will see basic metadata:

<img src="images/listing.png" width="750" />

- Once they click "View a HIT in this group," they see whatever your site is serving up, in our case this is the default:

<iframe src="http://puncture.psych.nyu.edu:5001/mturk?assignmentId=ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE&hitId=dummyhit"></iframe>
 
---

# A Participant Accepts

Upon accepting the HIT, they see... whatever you want them to see! In our case,
it's this:

<iframe src="http://puncture.psych.nyu.edu:5001/mturk?workerId=testing&assignmentId=testing&hitId=testing"></iframe>

---

# A look at the URLs

That last URL would look like this .red[*]:

- http://puncture.psych.nyu.edu:5001/mturk?assignmentId=.red[XX]&hitId=.red[XX]&workerId=.red[XX]

Basic syntax is as follows:

- http://.yellow[yoururl]?.red[**assignmentId**=XX]&.blue[**hitId**=XX]&.green[**workerId**=XX]

	- .yellow[**yoururl**] is wherever your server is ready for requests.
	- .red[**assignmentId**] is the unique ID assigned by Amazon to the event of
	  this particular person taking performing this particular HIT.
	  ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE means they haven't accepted yet.
	- .blue[**hitId**] is the Amazon ID associated with this HIT.
	- .green[**workerId**] is the Amazon ID associated with each unique worker.

.footnote[.red[*] The .red[XX] are shorthand for usually long strings of letters and numbers.]
---

# Finishing up

The last thing served to the participant is a button they can use to inform
Amazon that they have finished the HIT. This submits a form with their
identifying information to `http://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit`.
