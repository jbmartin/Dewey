What is this?
============

Dewey is a framework for quickly building and deploying research-based web apps.
Stack includes Flask, Backbone, FontAwesome, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, Marionette, Underscore, Requirejs, CoffeeScript, JStats, and D3.

I mainly use this as a boilerplate for my new projects, but feel free to use and contribute however you'd like. 
In the future, I'd like to make this an extension to [HTML5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). 
The default setup would then follow many of the web's current best-practices.
